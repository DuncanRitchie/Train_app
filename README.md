# Train app
An unfinished site for train information, as a Code Nation project to develop skills with React.js, API calls, and working in a team of three.

We never got it to fetch information on return journeys or ticket prices, but we were quite proud of what we did get done, given that we were only about eight weeks into our software development careers.

Pages:
* The [home-page](https://cn-train-app.herokuapp.com/home) gives information about departures for the time, origin station, and destination you specify.
* The [news page](https://cn-train-app.herokuapp.com/news) gives current disruption information relating to a station you put in.
* The [station page](https://cn-train-app.herokuapp.com/station) lists stations with names that match what you put in.

You can find the [demo on Heroku](https://cn-train-app.herokuapp.com/).

Hereâ€™s a screenshot of the home-page:<br>
